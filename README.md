# IOAM API with Protocol Buffers v3

**This version is specific to Cross-Layer Telemetry.**

IOAM API with Protocol Buffers v3, see [ioam_api.proto](./ioam_api.proto). It is based on the [Data Fields for In-situ OAM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-data) draft.

This API is currently used by the [IOAM agent for Python](https://github.com/Advanced-Observability/ioam-agent-python/tree/clt) and is available for any agent/collector requirements.

Right now, only the IOAM Trace Option is supported.
